            <p>When I began my journey in IT through a diploma program, coding was just another unit on the syllabus. I remember constantly asking myself, “Where on earth am I going to apply this?” At the time, it felt like abstract logic with little connection to the real world.</p>

<p>After completing my diploma, I pursued a degree in IT. During that period, I started working as an IT Support Officer. It was a stable role that grounded me in the technical side of the workplace—troubleshooting hardware, maintaining systems, and helping users navigate day-to-day tech issues. But over time, the routine set in, and I realized I was no longer challenged or growing.</p>

<p>It was my sister who nudged me back into coding. She saw the growing demand for digital solutions—systems, websites, apps—and reminded me of the foundation I already had. That conversation changed everything. I revisited code with a new mindset, driven not by assignments or deadlines, but by the desire to build and create.</p>

<p>This portfolio represents that return to coding.</p>

<p>Currently, I’ve been working on a personal website—my first step in applying my skills to something tangible and useful. It's more than just a portfolio; it's a reflection of my story, skills, and evolving identity as a developer. Through it, I’ve sharpened my understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and responsive design principles. I’ve also started integrating tools like Git and version control into my workflow, which has helped me work more efficiently and professionally.</p>

<p>Building this site from scratch reminded me why coding matters. It’s not just about syntax; it’s about solving problems and bringing ideas to life. The same curiosity that made me question its usefulness years ago is now what drives me to keep learning.</p>

<p>But as I got deeper into development and continued working in IT support, another realization began to take shape. I started noticing just how much data is collected in the workplace—logs, reports, user activity, system performance metrics—and how little of it is actually used. Most of it just sits there, untouched, while teams continue to make decisions based on guesswork or habit.</p>

<p>That’s when I became drawn to data science.</p>

<p>The idea that data could be used to solve real problems and drive smarter decisions sparked a new passion in me. I’ve since begun exploring data analysis, visualization, and the foundations of machine learning. I’m learning how to ask the right questions, clean and analyze datasets, and use insights to guide actions—something I believe every organization, including my current workplace, could benefit from.</p>

<p>Now, I see my journey not as a shift from one interest to another, but as a layering of skills. IT gave me the foundation. Coding gave me the power to build. And data science is giving me the ability to ask why and answer it with confidence.</p>

<p>Each project I take on from here—whether it’s a system to improve workflows, a website for a client, or a small automation script—will be part of this renewed journey. I'm no longer just someone who “knows IT.” I'm becoming a developer with purpose, and this portfolio is just the beginning.</p>
